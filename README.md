# cash_register
a simple cash register application used as a code sample

Written - November 22, 2018

	CashRegister.java (main)
	Item.java
	WeighedItem.java
	QuantifiedItem.java

Assumptions made: 

- items already in cart do not show up on receipt twice, items are added together
- items cannot be modified, only added or removed
- both taxes (GST and PST) apply

Features to be added in future if continued:

- ability to add custom items to groceries
- ability to modify items
- option to continue to next customer
- display ALL discounts applied (currently only displays the $5 off of $100 or more purchases discount)
- fix an occasional bug where a certain error message is displayed twice
